### What is Power Ledger?
---
Power Ledger is an Australian peer to peer electricity trading platform powered by blockchain technology. Traditionally, electricity is provided by large power grids controlled by large companies which push electricity to consumers at a price set by a select few companies. Power Ledger allows people with solar panels which produce more electricity than they need (prosumers) to sell this electricity to people looking for alternatives to the big electricity providers in Australia (consumers).

It's a win win for both prosumers and consumers. The prosumers get a better price than if they were selling their energy back to the likes of Origin Energy and AGL, and the consumers also get a better price than buying straight from these companies.

### How does it work?
----
'Sparks' are the the energy credits that are traded on their platform, which are backed 1:1 by 'Power tokens', Power Ledgers blockchain token.
Power ledgers technology allows users not only to trade their electricity in the form of 'Sparks' but also to track and trace their energy usage watt by watt in real time.

Other features of the Power Ledger platform include:

- P2P energy gifting 
- Trading in unused electrcity for vouchers
- Energy sharing for business owners with multiple stores
- Choice of preferred energy source for environmentally inclined users

### Who are they working with?
----
Power Ledger opened for business in 2016 and have been in operation for 5 years now, since then they have amassed a portfolio of over 30 large scale projects in over 20 countries around the world. From rural community energy markets to small cities in Europe, Power ledger is leading the way for P2P renewable energy markets.


### Benefits for prosumers
----
- Ability to save on their own energy costs and make extra income from unused energy
- Incentivises the switch to renewable energy


### Benefits for consumers
----
- Access to cheaper renewable energy
- Access to real time data about their energy usage
- Potential to sell excess electricity

### Comments
---
Power Ledger seems to have a great technology behind them and a fantastic vision for a future fuelled by distributed renewable energy. Unfortunately they don't seem to be as successful or widely used as they could be, perhaps they are a little too ahead of the curve.
